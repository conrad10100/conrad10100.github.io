		<p>I'm currently in my second year of Computer Science at York University. I studied civil engineering for two years at McMaster University before changing to Computer Science at York University.
      I originally planned on becoming a seismic engineer before my switch. Some areas I am interested in include web development, automation
	as well as game development.</p>
